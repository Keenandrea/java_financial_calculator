# java_financial_calculator

DESCRIPTION:
Financial calculator application created in JavaFX using the Eclipse IDE. The application calculates the future value of 
an investment in American currency. There are four textfield panes of input used in the application. The user inputs an
investment amount, the number of years that amount will marinate, and the annual interest rate. These numbers will be 
formulated and the future value will be output.
